# What is VC Client

[VC Client](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer) is a client software for real-time voice changers that uses AI such as [MMVC](https://github.com/isletennos/MMVC_Trainer) and [so-vits-svc](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc). It also provides an app for recording training audio for real-time voice changers, specifically for MMVC.

- Please use the [official notebook](https://github.com/isletennos/MMVC_Trainer) for MMVC training.
- Please use the [official notebook](https://github.com/isletennos/MMVC_Trainer) for so-vits-svc training.

# Features

1. Cross-platform compatibility
   Supports Windows, Mac (including Apple Silicon M1), Linux, and Google Colaboratory.

2. No need to install a separate audio recording app
   Audio recording can be done directly on the application hosted on Github Pages. Since it runs entirely on the browser, there is no need to install any special application. Additionally, since it works entirely as a browser application, no data is sent to the server.

3. Distribute the load by running Voice Changer on a different PC
   The real-time voice changer of this application works on a server-client configuration. By running the MMVC server on a separate PC, you can run it while minimizing the impact on other resource-intensive processes such as gaming commentary.

# usage

Details are summarized [here](https://zenn.dev/wok/books/0004_vc-client-v_1_5_1_x).

# (1) Recorder (Voice Recording App for Training)

This is an app that allows you to easily record training voice for MMVC. It can be run on Github Pages, making it available from various platforms with just a browser. The recorded data is saved in the browser and will not leak externally.

[Explanation video](https://youtu.be/s_GirFEGvaA)

# (2) Player (Voice Changer App)

This is an app for performing voice changes with MMVC and so-vits-svc.

It can be used in three main ways, in order of difficulty:

- Using Google Colaboratory (MMVC only)
- Using a pre-built binary
- Setting up an environment with Docker or Anaconda and using it

For those who are not familiar with this software or MMVC, it is recommended to gradually get used to it from the top.

## (2-1) Use on Google Colaboratory (MMVC only)

You can run it on Google's machine learning platform, Colaboratory. If you have already used Colaboratory, you do not need to prepare anything as the training of MMVC model has been completed. However, the voice changer may have a large time lag depending on the network environment or the situation of Colaboratory.

- [Simple version](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer/blob/master/VoiceChangerDemo_Simple.ipynb): You can run it from Colab without any prior setup.
- [Normal version](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer/blob/master/VoiceChangerDemo.ipynb): You can load the model by cooperating with Google Drive.

## (2-2) Usage with pre-built binaries

You can download and run executable binaries.
We offer Windows and Mac versions.

- For Mac version, after unzipping the downloaded file, double-click the `startHttp_xxx.command` file corresponding to your VC. If a message indicating that the developer cannot be verified is displayed, please press the control key and click to run it again (or right-click to run it). (Details below \* 1)

- For Windows version, we offer `ONNX(cpu, cuda), PyTorch(cpu)` version, `ONNX(cpu, cuda), PyTorch(cpu, cuda)` version, and `ONNX(cpu, DirectML), PyTorch(cpu)` version. Please download the zip file corresponding to your environment. After unzipping the downloaded zip file, please run the `start_http_xxx.bat` file corresponding to your VC.

- The following voice changers can be launched with each `startHttp_xxx.command` file (Mac) and `start_http_xxx.bat` file (Windows).

| #   | Batch file                                | Description                                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | start_http_v13.bat                        | MMVC v.1.3.x series models can be used.         |
| 2   | start_http_v15.bat                        | MMVC v.1.5.x series models can be used.         |
| 3   | start_http_so-vits-svc_40.bat             | so-vits-svc 4.0 series models can be used.      |
| 4   | start_http_so-vits-svc_40v2.bat           | so-vits-svc 4.0v2 series models can be used.    |
| 5   | start_http_so-vits-svc_40v2_tsukuyomi.bat | Use Tsukuyomi-chan's model. (Cannot be changed) |
| 6   | start_http_so-vits-svc_40v2_amitaro.bat   | Use Amitaro's model. (Cannot be changed)        |

- If you are connecting remotely, please use the `.command` file (Mac) or `.bat` file (Windows) with https instead of http.

- If you have an Nvidia GPU on Windows, it will usually work with the `ONNX(cpu,cuda),PyTorch(cpu)` version. In rare cases, the GPU may not be recognized, in which case please use the `ONNX(cpu,cuda), PyTorch(cpu,cuda)` version (which is much larger in size).

- If you do not have an Nvidia GPU on Windows, it will usually work with the `ONNX(cpu,DirectML), PyTorch(cpu)` version.

- If you are using `so-vits-svc 4.0`/`so-vits-svc 4.0v2` on Windows, please use the `ONNX(cpu,cuda), PyTorch(cpu,cuda)` version.

- To use `so-vits-svc 4.0`/`so-vits-svc 4.0v2` or `tsukuyomi-chan`, you need the content vec model. Please download the ContentVec_legacy 500 model from [this repository](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec), and place it in the same folder as `startHttp_xxx.command` or `start_http_xxx.bat` to run.

## (2-3) Usage after setting up the environment such as Docker or Anaconda

Clone this repository and use it. Setting up WSL2 is essential for Windows. Additionally, setting up virtual environments such as Docker or Anaconda on WSL2 is also required. On Mac, setting up Python virtual environments such as Anaconda is necessary. Although preparation is required, this method works the fastest in many environments. **<font color="red"> Even without a GPU, it may work well enough with a reasonably new CPU </font>(refer to the section on real-time performance below)**.

## Real-time performance

Conversion is almost instantaneous when using GPU.

https://twitter.com/DannadoriYellow/status/1613483372579545088?s=20&t=7CLD79h1F3dfKiTb7M8RUQ

Even with CPU, recent ones can perform conversions at a reasonable speed.

https://twitter.com/DannadoriYellow/status/1613553862773997569?s=20&t=7CLD79h1F3dfKiTb7M8RUQ

With an old CPU (i7-4770), it takes about 1000 msec for conversion.
